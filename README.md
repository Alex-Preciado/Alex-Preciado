### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a Quantum Software Development Manager at [Xanadu](https://xanadu.ai), leading our Core and High Performance Computing (HPC) squads in the development of PennyLane, our open-source software to leverage quantum computers for Machine Learning, Quantum Computing and Quantum Chemistry ðŸ˜Ž (Visit [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai) for more details). I'm also an AI & Data Analytics Instructor at [York University](https://yorku.ca) currently teaching Database Fundamentals as part of the MBAN and MMAI programs at [Schulich School of Business](https://schulich.yorku.ca).

Before joining Xanadu, I worked as a Data Engineering Manager at HelloFresh leading the Data Engineering, Machine Learning and Software Engineering efforts of the Canadian Data Team while playing an active role in multiple Data Literacy, Data Infrastructure, and Data Governance initiatives.

I also worked as a computational astrophysicist developing software and predictive models to analyze astrophysical data as a postdoctoral researcher at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. I was part of the team that captured the first-ever image of the black hole at the centre of our galaxy using the Event Horizon Telescope.

My main competencies:

- Strategic Planning, Team Management & Leadership
- Software Development (Python, C++)
- High Performance Computing
- Data Science & Data Engineering (ETLs, Database Management, Predictive Modelling)
- Machine Learning (MLOps)
- Teaching and Instruction
- Theoretical Physics (Quantum Computing and Astrophysics)
