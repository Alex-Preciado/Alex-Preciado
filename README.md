### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as a Quantum Software Development Manager at Xanadu leading our Core and High Performance Computing (HPC) squads in the development of PennyLane, our open source software to leverage quantum computers for Machine Learning, Quantum Computing and Quantum Chemistry ðŸ˜Ž (Visit [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai) for more details).

Before joining Xanadu, I worked as a Data Engineering Manager at HelloFresh Canada leading the Data, Machine Learning and Software Engineering efforts of the Canadian Data Team while playing an active role in multiple initiatives, including: Data Infrastructure and Tooling, Data Literacy and Data Governance.

I also worked as a computational astrophysicist developing software and predictive models to analyze astrophysical data as a postdoctoral researcher at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada. I was part of the team that captured the first-ever image of the black hole at the centre of our galaxy using the Event Horizon Telescope.

My main competencies:

- Leadership
- Software Development (Python, C++)
- Data Science (predictive modelling)
- Data Engineering (ETLs, Database Management)
- Machine Learning (MLOps)
- High Performance Computing
- Theoretical Physics
